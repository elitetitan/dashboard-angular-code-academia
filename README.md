Created an admin dashboard using angular material, highcharts and flex-layout.
It consists of a sidebar as well that can be toggled via a menu button(hamburger) at the top left.

## Running the app

You must have node.js and angular cli installed. The app has been developed using the following versions: Node.js -> 15.4.0 Angular cli -> 11.0.7 Download the files and head to the root folder(the one containing the files) in command line.

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
